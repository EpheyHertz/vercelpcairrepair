## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Axios**: For handling API requests to the backend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first responsive and modern styling.
- **JWT Authentication**: For managing user sessions and secure access to protected routes.

### Backend
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework.
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: For building the API backend.
- **JWT Authentication**: Used for secure token-based authentication.
- **MySQL**: The database used for storing user profiles, chats, and diagnoses.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Hosted on **Vercel**.
- Handles authentication, state management, and API calls using Axios.
- Responsive user interface designed with Tailwind CSS.

### Backend (Django Rest Framework)
- Hosted on **Render**.
- Provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, chat functionality, and diagnostics.
- Uses JWT for secure user authentication.
- **MySQL** database for storing data.

### Cloud Storage (Backblaze)
- Used for storing user-uploaded profile pictures.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

1. Clone the frontend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EpheyHertz/pcairepairfrontend.git
   cd pcairepair-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://aipcrepair.onrender.com/apis/
```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
```

   Visit the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

1. Clone the backend repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EpheyHertz/pcairepairbackend.git
    cd aipcrepair-backend
```

2. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your MySQL database and configure the `settings.py` file:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'your_db_name',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
            'HOST': 'your_db_host',
            'PORT': 'your_db_port',
        }
    }
```

4. Set up environment variables for JWT authentication in `.env`:

    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

5. Run the migrations and start the server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
```

   Visit the API at `http://localhost:8000`.
